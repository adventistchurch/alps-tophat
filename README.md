### Getting Started

- run `grunt`
- run `grunt prod` for production cdn files


## Project Standards

### Front-End General Best Practices
1. Separation of presentation, content, and behavior.
2. Markup should be well-formed, semantically correct, and generally valid (if possible).
3. Javascript should progressively enhance the experience.
4. Always keep performance at top of mind when coding.

### CSS Coding Standards
The CSS in this project follows [Harry Robert's](http://csswizardry.com/) [itcss](http://itcss.io/) architecture. [CSS/SCSS Coding Best Practices](http://cssguidelin.es/) should be the referenced standards guide when writing sane, manageable, scalable CSS.

### Git Commit Messages
All commit messages should abide by the following criteria:

* Begin with a one line summary. It should be short (50 chars or less).
* This should be followed by a longer description if necessary.
* The first two items should be separated by an empty line.
* All lines should be wrapped at approximately 72 characters.
* Reference an issue in your commits whenever possible. Use the [Github standard](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) ```gh-34``` for ticket ```#34```.
* If you forget to reference the issue in your commit, and the commit has already been pushed, reference the commit hash in a comment on the ticket.

### Troubleshooting Installs

Make sure you are running your terminal/command line session as administrator. This could mean `sudo`, or opening the window with a right-click option.
